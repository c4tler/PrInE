Requires NTL c++ library

Written by Catherine Murdoch - catherine@catherinemurdoch.net

I wrote this program as my response to a google recruitment challenge from a while ago. I felt like 
it would be an interesting challenge and a way to become more familiar with the ntl library. It 
probably would have been easier to write in another language rather than c++, but so far im only 
really familiar with c++. However, I plan to rewrite it in Java, as Im currently learning it, and 
then C# and python at some point, just as an exercise in getting a feel for which languages are better for 
different functionalities.
